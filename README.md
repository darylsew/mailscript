mailscript
==========

Script to poll my emails for print jobs from roommates/friends. Feel free to do as you like with it. :3

##TO DO
[x] Get it working  
[ ] Attempt to reinstantiate connection if imap aborts
[ ] Delete email after printing attachment  
[ ] Only allow emails from certain people to result in print jobs  
[ ] Encrypt email password (input from config file currently)  
[ ] Threaded approach? Could be more efficient.  
[ ] Refactor neatly  
[ ] Keep track of print volume from different users; calculate costs and charge accordingly  
[ ] Improve documentation  
[ ] Create a non-OS dependent solution  
[ ] Pretty graphs
